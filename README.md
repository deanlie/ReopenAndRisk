Branch Testing1234:
  Accomplished:
  * Learn to use shinytest.
  * Set up automatic test to run vaccination tab through just US, MA & ME, and 4 MA counties DONE
  * Ditto for remaining tabs as of Sept 26

  TO DO:
  * Deal with dynamic data. Docs say, 
    "Problem: Dynamic data. If your application uses a data source that changes over time, 
      then a snapshot taken yesterday may not match a snapshot taken today,
      even if the app itself hasnâ€™t changed. Dynamic data inherently poses a challenge for
      snapshot-based testing.

    This problem can be avoided by detecting when the application is being tested,
      and in that case use a static data set instead. To do the detection,
      you can do something like the following:
      
      if (isTRUE(getOption("shiny.testmode"))) {
        # Load static/dummy data here
      } else {
        # Load normal dynamic data here
      }""
      
    To view differences between expected and current results, run:
      viewTestDiff(".", "mytest")
    To save current results as expected results, run:
      snapshotUpdate(".", "mytest")
      
    The testmode option is not available when the program is first loaded, maybe only when
      a server instance is initialized.
